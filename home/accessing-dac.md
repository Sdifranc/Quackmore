# Accessing DAC

## Introduction

DAC is the user interface of DAC’s Design Studio. The DAC environment is a web-based analysis environment where apps created in DAC Design Studio are published.

In the Home Page you can see all deployed applications in your Space and associated with your group. If just one application has been associated with a user he will directly access the pages of the app after login.
