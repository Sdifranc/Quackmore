# Recent Content

In DAC you can quickly navigate the contents that you visited \(Report, Page, Spaces, Document, Blog Post, and Task\) with the feature **Recent Contents**. You can view a list of the most recent content you have visited, and go back and forth among objects you last visited without having to search in your applications.
