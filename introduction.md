# Introduction

Decisyon App Composer \(DAC\) offers you sophisticated functionality for visualizing and interacting with presentation objects, and full navigation and customization of app pages, reports and overall applications. It is the user interface of DAC’s Design Studio. Using DAC, you can access the various functional modules in the platform, such as collaboration, analytics, drill down capabilities, report and dashboard visualization.‌

DAC allows you to create and view reports, charts, KPIs, and correlated objects through a web interface. You can export the reporting function in popular formats, such as Adobe PDF or Microsoft Excel, thereby enabling users to easily access that information.‌

The analysis you generate in DAC is fully navigable, and can be analyzed through the use of drilling, pivoting, slice-and-dice, and sorting functions. You can reorganize any data view with simple drag-and-drop moves or by clicking on toolbar buttons to create visualizations that meet users’ needs.‌

**Note**: While DAC can be accessed from both PCs and Tablets, some functions are not available in Tablet mode. Those limitations are indicated within the relevant sections of this manual, and a complete list of functions that are not available in Tablet mode is provided in the Appendix.‌

This manual provides you with all essential instructions on how to get started using DAC, navigating within that environment, and using and customizing DAC’s main features and functions. Clicking on blue underlined text will lead you to the associated topic.‌

In order to access DAC, it is necessary to download the DAC DevBox. All the installation information is available in the DAC - Design Studio manual or in the [starter kit](http://decisyon.com/docs/Decisyon_App_Composer_Starter_Kit.pdf). After you download the DAC DevBox to your local machine, you will have access to the following:‌

1. **Design Studio \(DS\):** A local development environment where you can create, edit, test and deploy applications to Predix.‌
2. **DAC:** Cloud environment that can be executed both locally and/or in the Predix cloud, and where users can perform analysis and collaborate on the deployed application.‌

Before accessing DAC, we strongly suggest you follow the instructions in the [**starter kit**](http://decisyon.com/docs/Decisyon_App_Composer_Starter_Kit.pdf) guide that will allow you to push DAC to the Predix cloud and get all the references for the web access.‌

In general, once a developer creates an app in DAC-DS and pushes it to Predix, he will obtain an ad hoc URL that can be accessed by all users in order to visualize the application in the Predix cloud. The Username and Password to access DAC are the same used to login in the Predix spaces.‌

If you are an end user that has not been involved in the app composing process in DAC-DS you need to get the web link from the App administrator, and then you can use your Predix login credentials.‌

If you want to open the pushed DAC in Predix directly within DAC - Design Studio, click the “Open in Predix” button on the toolbar.‌

When you have access to DAC, as a user, you have been associated with specific privileges and groups. In fact, as part of the DAC-DS functions a developer needs to create user profiles and groups that will be able to view and work with each element of the app. It also enables you to create a collaboration team at DAC. Refer to the [access on DAC](http://documents.decisyon.com/tomcat/manuals/user/ge/en/web/accessingDac.htm#_Toc207105920) section in this manual for an overview. Or, for more detailed information, please use the DAC-DS manual.‌

In general a DAC user can:‌

Access one or more pages available in an application, analyze data, collaborate in context with his colleagues, and finally take decisions.‌

Interact with the Decisyon App Composer to create new objects \(report, metrics and filters\). Moreover he can use all the available OLAP functions \(drill, pivoting, slice and dice\).‌

Modify all published reports, saving a new copy to his own folders, without modifying the existing reports created by other users.‌

Create and manage social spaces and groups and the existing initiatives.‌

Apply all the native collaboration capabilities like discussions and tasks.[NextUntitled](https://app.gitbook.com/@silvia-difrancesco/s/dac-doc/~/drafts/-M2sQWspQeH4NX2_dCu8/untitled)[
