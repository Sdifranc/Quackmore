# Paging

You can establish the number of rows and columns the report is to be arranged into. This lets determine the number of pages needed to display the extracted data.

Simply choose the number of rows and columns from the menu available for the **Rows** and **Cols**; for each one of these, the actual number of rows and columns in the report is indicated in brackets. Use the drop-down lists to select a different number of rows and/or columns.

The _page buttons_, represented by arrows, let you scroll through the pages that a report is subdivided into; the direction of the arrows indicates the direction of movement. The double arrow lets you move to the last or first page.
