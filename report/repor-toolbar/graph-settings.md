# Graph Settings \(in progress\)

The published reports, or reports that are created by the user, may be placed in graph form by selecting the **Graph Settings** folder and from there using the commands to choose the type of graph to be applied to the report.

The style of the graph is chosen by first selecting the graph category \(area, line, bar\), and then selecting the specific category type \(area in percentage, stacked areas, etc.\). The type of graph is chosen in the field **Graph Type**. The graph category automatically lists the types of graphs available for the category.

It is also possible to change the sizes of the graph by setting a width \(**Width** field\) and a height \(**Height** field\).

This bar is active only if the report is displayed in a graph or document format, i.e. if in the Main folder the items outlined in red in the figure below are selected:
